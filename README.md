# UWEE scripts
Some small helper scripts for UW's VLSI courses. Along with a few other scripts/programs for the department's linux's server.

### Still under construciton....

## USE
Either directly download or clone this repo to use. The scrpts for the classes are under the directory `src-476`. Currently there are two files `FormatPath.py` and `genfiles.py`. All of which can be directly called in commands line. `FormatPath.py` generates all subdirectories of a cad folder based on the course's standard using a `specifications.json` file under the same directory with the program. And `genfiles.py` attemptes to use the `specifications.json` file to generate most of the files and directlies of a turnin folder. *This programs heavily relies on the course's directory standard.*  
The other folder `ece_src` contains some helper scripts for more general ece linux server users.
